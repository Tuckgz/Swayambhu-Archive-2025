1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,159
 So, Pratapur and Anandapur were built by the Pratamala, the king Pratamala.

2
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:14,239
 And he was like the king, who is a tantric king, and he want to make some, these two

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,799
 buildings, Pratapur and Anandapur.

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,680
 But for what purpose did he want to make it?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,200
 He want to build for the protection of his power, to show his thing, yeah.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,520
 Because something he want to build, we are giving his name, as Pratapur and Anandapur.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,680
 Because he was the king, to show his power.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,319
 And his legacy, he show his legacy, so he build that one.

9
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:47,000
 And that time, like this two Sikharasaili, the Sikhara style, is because he is second

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,639
 wife Anandapur from India, so he was very much fond about that place.

11
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:58,259
 And here, in India, he saw this Sikhara Saili, so he brought that type of style up here,

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,639
 and he build this one.

13
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:06,160
 And so, when he build, it was objected by the people, other people, don't build it.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 What people?

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 Community people.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 Meaning who exactly?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 Who is the community?

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 Priest, Buddhacharya people, and other people too.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,760
 And it was objected, don't build it, don't make it, don't make it.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,720
 Because it is, like there is a stupa here.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,199
 And Anandapur is a little bit back than the hill, because it is built in, after the people,

22
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:38,720
 if you dig inside, it is like a different, like a brick wall is there, wall, and other

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 mud.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,279
 Like, so it is extension, this hill, extension of hill.

25
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:52,040
 So the people doesn't want to do like that, and people, community people doesn't want

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
 to do it.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,959
 But what he done, after hearing that, he just make a, like, close this stupa.

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,559
 Nobody was allowed to come up and do a praying up in the spring, for the six months.

29
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,399
 And lastly, like the people said, okay, build it.

30
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:18,679
 Now build it, because it is your power, if you feel like that, then build it.

31
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,800
 So after that, it was built.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,559
 This is a story from the Rajbhok Mala, there is one book for that.

33
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:30,919
 So you were saying about the height?

34
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:38,759
 It is believed that this height, and the Swembu height was used to be the same, and same.

35
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,839
 So it was a problem.

36
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:45,520
 That's why after, some years after, when the Swembu was renovated, the Swembu's height

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,520
 was little bit, make a little bit bigger than that, the Sikharasweti, that building.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 And you said that the reason that these keep falling in the earth?

39
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:09,639
 From people, we believe, from my concept, that because of like, everybody was opposing

40
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,800
 about this, don't build it, don't build it.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,559
 But he just saw his legacy.

42
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,240
 So that's why now also, many times it's been broken.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,160
 Not only three times, we just only knew three times, but if you see old picture, drawing

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,720
 of the Swembu, always this pot-up bull is always with bamboo scarf, means something

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,800
 happened in that, and so they are making of that.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,119
 So always something is happening in that place.
