1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,159
 So, Pratapur and Anandapur were built by the Pratamala, the king Pratamala.

2
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:14,239
 And he was like the king, who is a tantric king, and he want to make some, these two

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,799
 buildings, Pratapur and Anandapur.

4
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:19,680
 But for what purpose did he want to make it?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,200
 He want to build for the protection of his power, to show his thing, yeah.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,600
 Because something he want to build, we are giving his name, as Pratapur and Anandapur.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,680
 Because he was the king, to show his power.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,319
 And his legacy, he show his legacy, so he build that one.

9
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:47,000
 And that time, like this two Sikharasaili, the Sikhara style, is because he is second

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,639
 wife Anandapur from India, so he was very much fond about that place.

11
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:58,259
 And here, in India, he saw this Sikhara Saili, so he brought that type of style up here,

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,639
 and he build this one.

13
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:06,160
 And so, when he build, it was objected by the people, other people, don't build it.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 What people?

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 Community people.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 Meaning who exactly?

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 Who is the community?

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
 Like priests, Buddhacharya people, and other people too.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,760
 And it was objected, don't build it, don't make it, don't make it.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,319
 Because it is like, there is a stupa here, and Pratapur is a little bit back than the

21
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,319
 hill.

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:34,519
 Because it is built in, after the people, if you dig inside, it is like a different,

23
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,319
 like a brick wall is there, wall, and other mud.

24
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,279
 So it is extension, this hill, extension of hill.

25
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:52,080
 So the people doesn't want to do like that, and people, community people doesn't want

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 to do it.

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:00,959
 But what he done, after hearing that, he just make a, like, close this stupa.

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,559
 Nobody was allowed to come up and do praying up in the spring, for the six months.

29
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:14,399
 And lastly, like, the people said, okay, build it, now build it.

30
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:18,679
 Because it is your power, if you feel like that, then build it.

31
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,759
 So after that, it was built.

32
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,559
 This is a story from the Rajbhok Mala, there is one book for that.

33
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:30,919
 So you were saying about the height?

34
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:38,759
 And it is believed that this height, and the swimming pool height used to be the same.

35
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:44,880
 So it was the problem, that's why after, some years after, when the swimming pool was renovated,

36
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,639
 the swimming pool height was little bit, make a little bit bigger than that.

37
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,520
 The Shikharas, that building.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:00,839
 And you said that the reason that these keep falling in the earth?

39
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:09,639
 From people, we believe, like, from my concept, that because of, like, everybody was opposing

40
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,759
 about this, don't build it, don't build it.

41
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,520
 But he just saw his legacy.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,199
 So that's why now also, like, many times it's being broken.

43
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,199
 Not only three times.

44
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,279
 We just only knew there are three times.

45
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:26,839
 But if you see old picture, drawing of the swimming pool, always there's this, put up

46
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,679
 pool is always with bamboo, sculpture.

47
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:34,759
 Something happened in that, and so they are making of that.

48
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,119
 So always something is happening in that place.
