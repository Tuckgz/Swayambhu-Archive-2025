00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 So, we can see many monkeys up here in Swayambhu.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 There is a story about them, is that the Manjushri, who had come to Kathmandu from Tibet, from China,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 and when he came here, and after draining all water, and settling the people up in the Kathmandu Valley,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 and after that he became a monk, and he cut his hair,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and when he cut his hair, it is believed that hair became all the forest up in this hill,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and the lice was there in the hair, and it is believed that lice became the monkeys.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And this is a concept from the Tibetan view,

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 there is a slit, it is believed that the story is called, like monkeys are the lice of the...

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 so there is a close relationship up here with the stupa.
