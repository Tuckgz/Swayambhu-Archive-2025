00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 The old woman and the chicken

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The old woman and the chicken

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 The narrator of this story is Karunakar Baidha.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 In one country there was an old lady named Teej Sarai, who was a beggar and had no wife

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 He went into the jungle and searched for a village where he was helpless. It was very difficult for him to feed himself.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 One day, while he was searching for firewood in the forest, he saw a chicken in the bushes.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Said Banaya had a flower for the chicken, he took the flower home and kept it in a big jar.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 A few days later, he found a nest for the chickens in the place where he had kept the flowers.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 When he went there, he saw two chicken chicks, which he thought were very good. The old woman did not eat the chicks herself, and her brother also gathered and ate them.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 One day that Kukhura went to the flowerbed and flowers started flowing. The old lady took the Kukhura and asked him to give her some money. I told her somewhere that she would take me along with her.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Hearing the chicken speak like a manchuk, the old woman was shocked and with great difficulty saved herself and gave the one penny she had saved.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 The shopkeeper, the shopkeeper, gave me one paisa worth of rice as soon as I saw it, and the shopkeeper said, &quot;How many tears does one paisa worth of rice make?&quot;

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And the chicken said, &quot;I put as much rice as I can in my ear canal.&quot; And the shopkeeper said, &quot;How many ears can be in a small ear canal?&quot; He said, &quot;I put rice in the chicken&#39;s ear.&quot; The psychiatrist went to the chicken&#39;s ear, but the shopkeeper&#39;s rice was too small.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,360
 This is your money, now go and get some rice for me.

15
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,119
 I have become like this because I didn&#39;t take my money earlier

16
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,300
 A little rice was spilled and the dust flew away.

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,960
 The house was built with the help of a dog.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,119
 Grandma, grandma, eat something.

19
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,520
 Bhudi le pani ukkhra le banig raste garn

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,300
 And take a knife and eat it with your ears,

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,699
 The little girl&#39;s hands were covered with rice.

22
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:37,100
 The chicken flew again and reached the pasture of the flying flower.

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,000
 Tesla Pani cheated him by taking chamal from him

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,800
 Put the old lady in the house and put a sprinkling of water on her

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,220
 Take a penny with three chickens.

26
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,820
 Salt, oil, spices, etc., were collected in green piles

27
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,619
 And with the help of the shepherd, she and the old woman and the dog built a large house like a palace.

28
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:05,220
 That old lady was as beautiful as a queen.

29
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,220
 Wealth and possessions were not lacking for any king.

30
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,220
 One day, the chicken decided to marry the daughter of the king of that country.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,220
 Every now and then they found a bee lice in the nest.

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,220
 And those ants made

33
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
 Kuphraap maa vya the world doesn&#39;t hear us

34
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,220
 Kukhra Dai Kukhra Dai where are you going

35
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,220
 And let&#39;s make it with a straw.

36
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,220
 Marry the daughter of the king of lice.

37
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,220
 And the bees made

38
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,220
 I know that you take me with you

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,220
 Which one of you will be working on?

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,220
 And I took the water from the knife and started keeping it inside my ears

41
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,220
 As he went, he made a big pond.

42
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,220
 And that pool left him.

43
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,220
 Where are you going, dog?

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,220
 And the chicken became the king&#39;s son and scattered the flock.

45
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,220
 And the water from the pond became the mud that flows through the river.

46
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,220
 Maybe I can be of some use to you.

47
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,220
 And the chicken also took the water from the pond in its beak.

48
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,220
 Tish Daura also asked the same question.

49
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,220
 And again the chicken became the king&#39;s treasure, scattering it.

50
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,220
 And the fire of wood was made, you also made me go with you.

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,000
 Sayth mother, can you do some work like this

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,760
 And the chicken became a chicken, so you gave me a chicken, sister.

53
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,299
 And the fire of the wood made me talk, &quot;What did you say?&quot;

54
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,779
 Even the old man put his ear to the pillow and took it.

55
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,739
 One day you will be caught in the royal court

56
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:05,220
 And flew away and sat on a branch of a tree.

57
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,339
 That day, Rajgo was about to be separated from his family.

58
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:13,140
 All of you have seen your good moves and happiness

59
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,140
 At that moment, the rooster crowed and became a rooster.

60
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,339
 O gatekeeper, I have come to leave the kingdom and join the Sangha.

61
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,619
 Bring the king and send him the news

62
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,420
 First of all, the doorkeeper is the one who listens to the kukhra

63
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,779
 But later the country started chasing some soldiers with stray dogs.

64
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,179
 And the chicken also with great agility

65
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:39,420
 Mauri brothers, the soldiers would have eaten everyone&#39;s heads

66
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,859
 It was only made by a handful of bees.

67
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,980
 The soldiers, while roasting, took a bite.

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,579
 The poor people, crying out in fear, came to the king to request everything.

69
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,700
 The king also thought it was wonderful and sent for the dog to call him.

70
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,019
 Then you should go to your home with a big gift

71
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:06,179
 Finally, the righteous king did not ride on horseback.

72
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,500
 Kukhra bhabhi hai your income is bad

73
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,420
 The king saw that the snake was very respectable and he drank it.

74
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,940
 Your Majesty, I have come to ask you to marry Azura&#39;s daughter.

75
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,619
 Please marry me to Azura&#39;s daughter.

76
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:24,739
 And the king said to the warrior Iktam

77
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:30,339
 Then I will go and make this girl with me and I will marry my most beautiful daughter

78
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,059
 This is my wish, I have to say this, I want to live your life

79
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,019
 And why is the number of chickens decreasing?

80
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:45,459
 And the dog also addressed the fire and ordered it to burn down the king&#39;s palace.

81
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:51,459
 The king had to take the Kukhra and the lamp was in his court, and he had to bowl in front of him.

82
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:57,380
 All the brothers started running everywhere, making a lot of noise.

83
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,739
 The king made millions of attempts to put out the fire.

84
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,220
 Then the people around him became angry and started shouting

85
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:12,019
 Finally, the king gave up and promised to marry his daughter to the dog.

86
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,579
 The three-legged dog gave the order for water to extinguish the fire.

87
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:22,019
 I answered the question, and first I stood before Ramnarayan&#39;s court with my sister in law.

88
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:28,019
 And the king took great pomp and show and married his daughter to Kukhra.

89
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:34,579
 Ani Kukhra Princess Baba Laskar accompanied by music came to her home

90
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,579
 Don&#39;t be surprised when you get a princess daughter-in-law.

91
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:49,579
 On that day, after seeing many servants and brothers, they went to Haruli Ghariyar and settled there happily.
